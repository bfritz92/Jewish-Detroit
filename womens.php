	      	<p>Women are asserting themselves more in business, the professions, the arts and the voting booth—and are taking on more obligation in the vital area of philanthropy.</p>

			<p>Women’s giving accounts for 18% of Detroit Federation’s Annual Campaign. By giving a gift in your own name, you embrace an identity that’s distinct and independent from that of another family members. A gift in your own name will:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Connect you to the Jewish community in a personal, powerful way</li>
			<li>Be a role model to thousands of other women</li>
			<li>Inspire the next generation to stand up and be counted</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Every gift matters. By making a gift in your own name, you play a vital role in creating social justice, aiding the vulnerable, preserving human dignity and building Jewish identity in Detroit, Israel and in Jewish communities around the world.</p>

			<a href="#" class="gray-link bold baskerville">Click here to make a gift to Federation’s Annual Campaign. <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></a>
			<br>
			<h4>Planned Giving </h4>
			<p>Leave a lasting legacy of support for your Jewish community. You can endow your gift at any level. Contact Susie Feldman at 248-203-1461 or feldman@jfmd.org for more information. </p>

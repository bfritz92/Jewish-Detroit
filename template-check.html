    <!-- wp:paragraph -->Many teens shared about how impactful being part of
    BBYO is on the teens mental health, especially through the COVID-19
    pandemic. “Everything was canceled, especially at the beginning of the
    pandemic, and it was really nice to see that BBYO kept going. It really
    helped us not feel isolated, especially in a time where it was so scary, we
    couldn’t really see our friends or do anything normal. Like sports are gone,
    most of your school clubs, even school was gone. And it was nice that BBYO
    was still there, your friends were still there, even though it was online,
    to still interact with.”

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
    <!-- wp:paragraph -->“Everybody is there [at BBYO] to connect with people.
    Being able to connect with people from outside of your school is what makes
    BBYO special. And so, with the programming aspect of it, I think that the
    programs do bring people together. The programs bring that light into your
    life when during a dark time. So yeah, it kind of just makes mental health a
    bit better than what it used to be.”
